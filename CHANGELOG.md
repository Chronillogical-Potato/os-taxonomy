# Changelog

All notable changes to the Marble Skill Taxonomy dataset are documented here.
Dataset releases are versioned independently of the taxonomy `version` field
(the underlying taxonomy is `v1`).

## [Unreleased]

- Add 1,050 teaching-research records for Science (547) and Mathematics (503), joined by stable topic ID, with explicit coverage for the other 540 topics.
- Publish portable learning guidance with activities, learner actions, feedback and evidence links; retain original pedagogy, assessment and historical source-verification metadata.
- Add teaching-research JSON Schema, cross-file/evidence-link validation, regression checks and a topic-file checksum binding.
- Mark curriculum-text publication omissions inline and by field path; exclude private database IDs, learner data and migration audit artifacts.
